# Game Description
The game consists of multiple rounds. In each round players are presented a question, a
choice of answers, and have to select one answer within the allotted time (10 seconds or
so). Players that chose a correct answer advance to the next round. Those who chose the
wrong answers are eliminated. The game continues until thereâ€™s only one winner left.

# Features:
- The application runs in completely automatic mode - i.e no admin
intervention should be required to start the game (once a minimum number of
players have joined) or advance the game to the next round.
- The application allows running multiple games simultaneously.
- The application allows a reasonably large number of players to participate
in each game (think hundreds).
- The application displays statistics about player choices at the end of each
round (how many players have chosen each answer).
